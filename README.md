# Playwright Learning

## Mission Statement

The goal of this mono-repository is to provide a structured and organized way to document my journey in learning Playwright, a powerful end-to-end testing framework for modern web applications. By recording lessons, taking notes, and storing code samples and resources, I aim to create a comprehensive training material that can be used as a reference and shared with others who are interested in learning Playwright.
